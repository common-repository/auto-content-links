Replace specific words in your content with a link

== Description ==

Ever find yourself turning same words over and over again into links in your content? Well not any longer! Auto Content Links allows you to set up specific words in your content, and replace them with a link to wherever you want.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My replacements inside of the href are messed up! =

If you have looped your replacements - maybe you have google to be replaced with bing, and bing to be replaced with google. It'll get itself into a mess and cause your post to look bad.

Avoid looping.
